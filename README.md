# Stock-market-Analyser
Created an interactive stock market analysis dashboard utilizing Tableau and Python (Pandas). The project involved
analyzing historical stock data for six major companies: Apple, Facebook, Google, Nvidia, Tesla, and Twitter. Data
manipulation included calculating key metrics such as moving averages, percent changes, and trading volumes. The
dashboard features multiple visualizations, including line charts, histograms, and detailed tables, allowing users to
explore and compare stock performance over time.
